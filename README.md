# NXT-Scripts

**Warning:** Do not trust these. Most of them work but may (and probably will) have bugs. Long-story-short: We're back in the 70's: we code these at our home and run them at college (hoping that bugs don't ruin our hapinness and exciment)

## How to run them?

Simple run 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/richin13/nxt-scripts.git # Clone the repo
$ cd nxt-scripts/ # Change dir to cloned repo
$ python scripts/line.py # Run the file
```

TODO: keep explaining what this repo is for.
